title: "Music and Gaming YouTuber's Thoughts on Upgrading PC to Windows 11 [Will Adobe Premiere Pro, Cubase 8.5, and Office 2013 Work?"
---

[Windows 11 has been officially released](https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows/windows-11) and I upgraded. This is a so-called "human pillar". I will update this page as needed.

My opinion is based on my personal experience, so upgrade at your own risk!

## PC specs of the author

First of all, here is a rough configuration for reference.

* OS: Windows 7 Pro → Windows 10 Pro → Windows 11 Pro←Now here

The configuration has changed in various ways along the way, but I have repeated free upgrades up to the present.

* CPU: Intel Core i7 10700

The OS is installed on this disk. Two Western Digital HDDs are installed for data storage, one [2TB](https://amzn.to/3vFCPzj) and the other [6TB](https://amzn.to/3C9tnXA).

* Audio interface: RME Babyface Pro

This is for recording microphones with good sound quality, and I'm not sure if I'll include it in my PC configuration, but just in case it has something to do with compatibility and such.

## First impression

* The feel of the operation is not much different. However, the UI is cool in places, and the screen transitions on the Windows settings screen are so crisp!
* I haven't mastered the new widget feature or the Android apps that run on it yet, but I'm sure they will be useful once I get used to them.

## Checking the operation of software used for video production, etc.

### Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Illustrator

Adobe software, the lifeline for video contributors.

I was able to start up the software. I opened the projects I have on hand, and they work fine.

I haven't tried encoding yet, but so far it looks fine.

I'm sure Adobe's reputation will be damaged if they can't run on the latest stable version of Windows, so I'm sure they'll take care of any problems they find soon.

### Cubase 8.5 Pro

The software I use to mix my singing.

I was worried because it was not the latest 11, but I was able to start it without doing anything.

I opened the video I uploaded the project file the other day, and I can play it without any problem with plug-ins and such.

By the way, I mainly used [Waves Gold](https://amzn.to/3npFCJt) and Invisible Limiter as plug-ins. I don't know if other plug-ins are supported yet.

### Word 2013, Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013

↑upLink to Office 2021

Microsoft Office as we know it.

I was scared to death when I saw an article saying that [Office 2013 is not available on Windows 11 and that I should buy Office 2021](https://forest.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/serial/yajiuma/1357213.html), but it works normally. Please don't give me that kind of scaremongering.

To be precise, [Microsoft's official position seems to be](https://blogs.windows.com/japan/2021/10/04/its-easier-to-create-together-with-microsoft-365-and-office-2021/) that "Office 2013 will not be supported on Windows 11\. I don't use Office that much on this PC, so I'm fine with it if it works.

## Impressions

It looks really easy to use, and as far as I'm concerned, I haven't had any major problems with it so far, so I'm satisfied with it.

I can use it with almost the same feel as before, and I'm looking forward to using the new features, which I'm sure will be great once I get used to them.

I've heard a lot of people complaining about the free upgrade, but is it really that much to complain about?

Of course, upgrading a device used for work is risky if even the slightest problem occurs, so we should be cautious, but I wonder if we should not be too negative about it.

I'll also post more updates on Twitter (@zalgo3 ), so please feel free to follow me there.
